                    OLUKOTIDE  reserves the right to alter these terms and conditions. No variation or alteration of these Terms and Conditions by the Tutor shall be valid unless approved in writing by OLUKOTIDE . The Tutor and OLUKOTIDE acknowledge that these terms shall govern legal rights and obligations between them.
                    1.STATUS OF THE TUTORS <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor is a self-employed tutor and nothing contained within this Agreement shall constitute the relationship of employer and employee and/or worker or a partnership between the Company and the Tutor. OLUKOTIDE  acts as an agent for the Tutor by introducing them to suitable Clients. <br>
                    ⦿ Once a tutoring position has been confirmed, you are entering into a contract between you (the Tutor) and the Client (the Student, or the Student’s parent/ guardian). <br>
                    ⦿ The Terms of contract entered into by you with the Client shall be in the offer email provided by OLUKOTIDE. Save where expressly provided for in these Terms, the Tutor has no power or authority to increase, reduce, or vary the tuition as set out or referred to in these Terms or to alter or waive any of these Terms or to bind or commit the Company in any way.
                    2.RESPONSIILITIES OF THE TUTORS <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor should carry out the tutoring services in a professional manner with due skill, diligence and care. <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor is responsible for the content of lessons. These are to be carried out with proper preparation in accordance with a particular course of study, and in accordance with the Client’s instructions and/or relevant exam syllabus. <br>
                    ⦿ Although OLUKOTIDE  has some teaching resources and may be able to support Tutors by providing suitable materials, Tutors should be aware that they are responsible for providing all reasonable teaching materials. <br>
                    ⦿ Provided the Client gives clear prior consent in writing, the Tutor may obtain educational resources such as textbooks on behalf of the Client/Student. OLUKOTIDE must be informed of any such arrangement to obtain educational resources. Tutors are reminded that in accordance with section 6 of this agreement, they agree not to accept funds directly from the Client for any reason. <br>
                    ⦿ Tutors are responsible for keeping their logbook up to date. This is a standard record of all lessons taught, which is to be signed by the Client after each lesson. If you are late in submitting these time sheets (see section 6 for details) or there is incorrect information on them, your payment may be delayed. If a Client disputes hours and the Tutor does not have a signed time sheet for the hours in question, we will be unlikely to be able to pay the Tutor for those sessions. <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor will write a lesson plan for the Student prior to their first lesson with the Student, and submit it to OLUKOTIDE prior to the first lesson so that it can be checked and approved. The Tutor will carry out an assessment on the first lesson. Within 24 hours of the first lesson the Tutor must write a detailed critical analysis of how the Student did on the assessment, particularly focusing on areas of strength and weakness and what should be worked on during the course of tuition and submit to Client and OLUKOTIDE. <br>
                    ⦿ If the Tutor ceases to work with OLUKOTIDE during a course of tuition, or ceases to work with a particular Student, either at their own behest or the behest of the Client, and the Student is continuing with their course of tuition from OLUKOTIDE, the Tutor will draft a final report. This report will describe the work that the Tutor has done with the Student, and the work that remains to be done. It will describe the Student’s areas of strength and areas of weakness. The aim of the report will be to enable a new Tutor to pick up where the old Tutor stopped. <br>
                    ⦿ Tutors are expected to be responsive when contacted by OLUKOTIDE. If you persistently fail to respond to communication from OLUKOTIDE (via email or telephone or both) then we reserve the right to remove you from our database. <br>
                    ⦿ We also reserve the right to remove you from our database for breaching this agreement in any way, including but not limited to breaching section 9 (truthfulness of information given to OLUKOTIDE). In addition we reserve the right to remove you from our database due to unreasonable, inappropriate or rude behaviour such that we feel we are unable to act as your agent. <br>
                    3.PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT <br>
                    ⦿ In consideration of OLUKOTIDE providing you with Students, you are not permitted to make private arrangements for tuition with Clients introduced by OLUKOTIDE or with new Client introduced by OLUKOTIDE’s Clients. Should you breach this obligation, you will be liable to account to OLUKOTIDE for all sums received by you from the Client/new Client without deduction and OLUKOTIDE shall be entitled to obtain an injunction against you to prevent further breaches. This obligation shall continue notwithstanding termination or completion or other discharge of this Agreement. <br>
                    ⦿ Any work referred to a Tutor by a Client of OLUKOTIDE must be billed through OLUKOTIDE on your behalf. OLUKOTIDE is willing to negotiate on commission for new Clients referred to you by our Clients but OLUKOTIDE must process the billing and bookings must be through OLUKOTIDE. <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor will not provide or agree to provide any services or carry out any work for the Client or the Student other than the Tuition, save with the prior consent of OLUKOTIDE. <br>
                    4.PAYMENT <br>
                    ⦿ OLUKOTIDE will agree the fee structure with the Client and this may not be changed by the Tutor or the Client without written authority of OLUKOTIDE. <br>
                    ⦿ OLUKOTIDE  collects fees due from Students/Clients after a completed session (4,8 10 or as the case may be) and passes them on to you, net of a commission. Payments will only be made after payment has been received from the Client. <br>
                    ⦿ You will not be paid directly by the Client. You will not be entitled to receive your fee until OLUKOTIDE has received payment from the Client. If  OLUKOTIDE does not receive payment in reasonable time, Tutors may obtain written permission from OLUKOTIDE to invoice the Client directly. <br>
                    ⦿ You must not accept any payment direct from the Client without written permission from OLUKOTIDE. Should you do so, all sums received by you will be immediately payable to OLUKOTIDE and shall be actionable through the Courts without further notice to you. <br>
                    ⦿ Completed and signed logbook must be submitted to OLUKOTIDE monthly via the email provided IF, after your last tuition session or in any event by 4pm on the following day, for the lessons during that month. If we receive correctly completed class date records on time, payment will be made to you promptly. <br>
                    ⦿ If you submit your class date late, you will not be paid until the next Payment Month. <br>
                    5.CANCELLATION POLICY <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor will provide to the Client notice of any proposed holiday dates and request the same from the Client, in order to schedule lessons at a convenient time for both parties. The Tutor must notify OLUKOTIDE of the schedule agreed. <br>
                    ⦿ In the event of cancellation of a scheduled lesson, OLUKOTIDE must be informed via email and an alternative date will be agreed between Client and Tutor. The notification of OLUKOTIDE of the cancellation and alternative Session date will speed up administration and prevent delays to your payment. <br>
                    ⦿ Tutors should be aware that Clients must give notice of cancellation of any session more than five hours before the session is due to begin. If notice is given by that time, there is no charge to rearrange the session, and the Tutor is not paid for a session that has not been taught. <br>
                    ⦿ If notice is given within five hours of the start time of the session, there are two options. If the Tutor views the reason for cancellation as being unavoidable, and they choose not to charge for the session, then OLUKOTIDE will not charge the Client for the Session on behalf of the Tutor. If the Tutor does not deem the reason for cancellation to be unavoidable, or requires payment nonetheless, OLUKOTIDE will charge the Client for the Session on behalf of the Tutor and will pass on the Tutor’s fees net of commission as usual. <br>
                    6.LIABILITY <br>
                    ⦿ OLUKOTIDE does not accept any liability for any claims by the Client arising out of or related to the carrying out of the tutoring services by you and you agree to indemnify OLUKOTIDE  without limit in respect of any such claims. <br>
                    ⦿ The Company shall have no liability to the Tutor for any loss, damage, expenses, payments or injury which the Tutor may incur arising from the security or state or condition of any premises in which the Tutoring is provided or from any act or omission of the Client, the Student or any third party occurring on any such premises or otherwise during the course of or in connection with the provision of the Tuition. <br>
                    ⦿ The Company shall have no liability for any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from any act or omission of the Tutor. The Tutor shall indemnify the Company and keep the Company fully and effectively indemnified on demand against any actions, claims, costs, losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and payments which may be brought against or suffered or incurred by the Company as a result of or in connection with, directly or indirectly, the provision of the Tuition by the Tutor, any act or omission by the Tutor, and any breach or non-performance of these Terms or the Terms of the Agreement between the Tutor and the Client by the Tutor. <br>

                    7.CONFIDENTIALITY <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor undertakes that they will not at any time during or after the conclusion of this agreement, disclose to any person any confidential information concerning the business, affairs, customers, clients or suppliers of OLUKOTIDE   Tutors, except that you may disclose OLUKOTIDE   Tutors’ confidential information as may be required by law, court order, or any governmental or regulatory authority. <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor undertakes not to make use of confidential information encountered through association with OLUKOTIDE   Tutors for any purpose other than to perform your obligations under this Agreement. <br>
                    8.DATA PROTECTION <br>
                    ⦿ OLUKOTIDE  uses tutor data for the purposes of the services that it provides. Tutors would be providing personal data consent to the use of that data by OLUKOTIDE for the purpose of effecting introductions to Clients, for billing and fee collection purposes and to enable OLUKOTIDE to contact the Tutor from time to time. <br>
                    9.TRUTHFULNESS AND ACCURATELY <br>
                    ⦿ The Tutor warrants and represents to the Company that all written and oral statements and information provided by the Tutor to the Company for the purpose of or in connection with the Tuition, including (but not limited to) personal information about the Tutor and/or your qualifications, credentials, references and suitability for providing the Tuition were when provided, and remain, true, complete and accurate. <br>
                    ⦿ If anything occurs which materially changes the information originally provided, such as but not limited to you being convicted of an offence subsequent to your check, you must inform the Company of this information in order that the information provided to the Company about yourself remains truthful and accurate. Also your profiles can be updated to reflect experiences acquired. <br>
